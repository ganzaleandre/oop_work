# OOP Work – Java Projects (Apache Ant)

This repository contains three Java projects developed for Object-Oriented Programming coursework. Each project is built using **Apache Ant** and can be compiled independently.

## 📁 Projects Included

- `HotelManagementSystem`
- `SiteConstructionManagementSystem`
- `TrafficFineManagementSystem`

Each project has its own `build.xml` and follows a standard Ant-based NetBeans project structure.

## 🛠️ How to Build Individually (with Ant)

You can build each project manually using the following commands (after installing Ant):

```bash
ant -f HotelManagementSystem/build.xml
ant -f SiteConstructionManagementSystem/build.xml
ant -f TrafficFineManagementSystem/build.xml
